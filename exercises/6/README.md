# Exercise #6: Modules

Terraform is ALL about modules.  Every terraform working directory is potentially a module that could be reused by others
This is what made Terraform so massively popular.

In this exercise, we are going to modularize the code that we have been playing with during this whole workshop, but instead of 
constantly redeclaring everything, we are just going to reference the module that we've created and see if it works.

First, create a main.tf file in the main directory for the 6th exercise.  Inside the main.tf file you created, please add the following:

```hcl

```
